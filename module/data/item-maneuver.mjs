/**
 * A Maneuver, as an Item a character owns.
 *
 * Almost all of it is description rather than effect: the type, what it costs, whether
 * it attacks, whether it needs a target. That is why the header of a Maneuver's file
 * carries the weight and its script is usually empty - a Basic Attack has no script at
 * all, because its behaviour *is* the attack engine.
 *
 * They are Items rather than a shared table for two reasons that have nothing to do
 * with the hotbar. Each Unique Ability is a Maneuver, and so is each Signature
 * Technique; both are bought per character with Technique Points, so a global list
 * cannot hold them. And a rule that forbids "any Maneuver tagged uniqueAbility" then
 * reads a tag off the document instead of needing somewhere new to keep that mark.
